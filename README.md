# Fibonacci-in-4-ways
Recursive,Top Down DP,Bottom Up DP,BottomUp DP with O(1) space complexity


1. Recursive Approach with Overlapping subproblem -> O(2^n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

2. Recursion + Memoization resulting in top down approach -> O(n) time and space complexity

3. Bottom Up approach using an array -> O(n) time and space

4. Bottom up with no array -> O(n) time and O(1) space
